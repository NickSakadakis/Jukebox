DONE
maybe make a the bot display messages when a user requests a song that doesnt exist in the library like
"Song not found in Library
Downloading...
Converting...
Complete"
and then it will queue it up


MAKE A DOWNLOADING PROGRESS BAR FOR WHEN ytdlp is downloading a song from teh search command
MAKE ACTIVE PLAYER BUTTONS TO SKIP 1 minute of the song, as well as 10 minutes


make live player title wrap its text up to the length of the player

Have Jukebox always showing 20 buttons when selecting songs.
- If list has less than 20 songs, gray out and disable useless buttons



Create a Song Request Log / Song History


have bot only allow interaction from members with a certain role

	
	
Make the local match weak message ephemeral

!!!!!!!!!!!!
When selecting a video form the youtube results it sometimes says This interaction failed
and the window doesnt disappear, probably trying to be deleted too fast



-needs more testing to try and reproduce
When a song ends (or the last song in the queue id assume too) the player gets 'stuck'
on showing the last song as if it was still playng the song, the player updates every 5 seconds
so if the song ends during those 5 seconds the player 'freezes' a snapshot but the song ends.



FEATURE CONSIDERATIONS
	if the user inserts a playlist link on Add a Song, and doesnt see or pick between Just a Song
		or the entire playlist, to play just the song they selected
		(current bot interaction plays nothing if the user didnt pick anything after 30 seconds)
